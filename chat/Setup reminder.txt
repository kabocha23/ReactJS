create-react-app chat
edit chat/index.html to add the <div id='root'></div>
edit chat/App.js to build the AppComponent
edit chat/App.css to set up the chat room layout

Manage State using Redux:
cd to root folder: yarn add redux react-redux

in chat/App.js:
import AddMessage, MessagesList, and Sidebar from ./containers/

We include the Sidebar, MessagesList, and AddMessage components.
They all have:
	-a presentational component, which manages the user interface
	-a container component, which manages its behavior and the data that the presentational component will show

Edit chat/index.js to initialize Redux, then import the chat reducer, and then create the store.
Instead of telling ReactDOM to render <App /> , enter Provider, which makes the store available to all the components of the app, without explicitly passing it down.

Create folder and file: src/actions/index.js:
import from ActionTypes.js and define the actions

Enter those action constants in src/constants/ActionTypes.js

The reducers take care of creating a new state when an action is dispatched. In particular:

when a message is added by us, we add it to the (local) list of messages
when we receive a message from the server, we add it to our list of messages
when we add a user (ourselves), we put it in the users list
when we get an updated users list from the server, we refresh

yarn add chance
yarn add ws

cd to project root folder (chat):
yarn start

cd to server folder:
node app.js
